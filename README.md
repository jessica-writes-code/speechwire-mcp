A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with secure, authenticated access to [SpeechWire](https://www.speechwire.com/) tournament data for speech-and-debate (forensics) competitions.

The server scrapes manage.speechwire.com behind an authenticated session and exposes structured tournament data through MCP tools, enabling AI assistants to help tournament directors manage judge assignments, rooms, teams, entries, and round pairings.

## Features

- **Judge management** — list judges, contact info, availability, school associations, judge types, and add new judges
- **Team & entry data** — team rosters, entries by team, hybrid/cross-school entries
- **Room management** — room lists, usage grids, room-vs-section counts
- **Schematics** — event lists, round-by-round pairings with judges, rooms, and competitors
- **Tournament structure** — timeslots, competition groupings
- **Results** — tab sheets with round outcomes, speaker scores, and placements
- **Account discovery** — list and select accounts and tournaments interactively
- **Session management** — automatic re-authentication on session expiry

## Installation

```bash
pip install speechwire-mcp
```

Or install from source for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jessica-writes-code/speechwire-mcp.git
cd speechwire-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Configuration

Set your SpeechWire credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export SPEECHWIRE_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export SPEECHWIRE_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

Or copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### Optional environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPEECHWIRE_ACCOUNT_ID` | *(discovered)* | Numeric account ID — skips account selection |
| `SPEECHWIRE_CIRCUIT_ID` | *(discovered)* | Numeric circuit ID — skips tournament selection |
| `SPEECHWIRE_TOURNAMENT_ID` | *(discovered)* | Numeric tournament ID — skips tournament selection |
| `SPEECHWIRE_MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Transport protocol: `stdio` or `sse` |
| `SPEECHWIRE_MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | SSE bind host |
| `SPEECHWIRE_MCP_PORT` | `8080` | SSE bind port |

When account/circuit/tournament IDs are omitted, the server enters **discovery mode** — use the `speechwire_list_user_accounts` and `speechwire_list_user_tournaments` tools to browse and select interactively.
